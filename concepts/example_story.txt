Charlie Laube, an adorable four-year old all-brown lagotto romagnolo that thinks in English but can't speak to humans is charged with murder of several stuffed animal dinosaurs and her owners (Kevin and Simone) are called to trial as character witnesses. Kevin is also very funny. Charlie is ultimately acquitted of her _crimes_.
